I was recently asked to create a short "quick reference" for cclib that could be handed out at the [2018 Avogadro User Group Meeting](https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadro-ugm2018/). Rather than directly reuse a [poster](/pdf/2018_molssi_poster.pdf) from the [MolSSI workshop on Python for Quantum Chemistry](https://molssi.org/2018/03/26/molssi-workshop-on-python-for-quantum-chemistry-and-materials-simulation/), I decided to try making a reference sheet in the style of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf) or [Modern Fortran](https://michaelgoerz.net/refcards/fortran_refcard_a4.pdf). The goal is to show the basic entry points and some code structure, including parts that many users might not know about, namely the methods. I'm also continually on the lookout for better examples of using the library.

The result can be found below. The `refsheet` LaTeX document class can be found [here](https://github.com/berquist/refsheet).  (2022-12-26: a newer implementation is at https://github.com/polyluxus/refcard)

<!-- My research interests primarily focus on electronic structure theory, and include: -->
<!-- - Pedagogical implementations of important algorithms, particularly in the context of [Psi4NumPy](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/). -->
<!-- - Using safe and strongly-typed yet highly-performant programming languages for algorithm implementations, such as Rust and Nim. -->
<!-- - Applying automatic differentiation to molecular property calculations. -->

<!-- For work, I am currently a research programmer for the [University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu/) in Waltham, MA. My focus is on natural language processing (NLP), specifically -->
<!-- - how to extract events from text, and -->
<!-- - software infrastructure for supporting NLP research. -->

<!-- My primary open-source contributions are to [cclib](https://cclib.github.io), a Python library for parsing computational quantum chemistry logfiles into a program-agnostic representation, making it easy to perform complex analyses. -->
